I built a lending and borrowing protocol like aave. The best thing is that I made it all by myself from 500 lines of solidity to frontend, it was even my first project that I made without any tutorial. I made it from scratch as I never used aave much but I researched about it and boom made it all by myself. Feel free to checkout my [twitter](https://twitter.com/harendrashakya_) if you have any doubts, I'm documenting my journey there.

Note: 
1. Please use Rinkeby testnet.
2. Everything is working but I used chainlink keepers for charging and rewarding APY, so it will not work when my funds will over, but the code is working fine, you could also check [this video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harendra-shakya-622649229_boom-i-made-it-i-build-a-lending-and-borrowing-activity-6950774885971304448-roVS?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app
